### Comparative Analysis of Companies in the Same Field

Statistical comparisons of groups of concerns operating in a given industry are a more or less routine part of the analyst’s work. Such tabulations permit each company’s showing to be studied against a background of the industry as a whole. They frequently bring to light instances of undervaluation or overvaluation or lead to the conclusion that the securities of one enterprise should be replaced by those of another in the same field.

In this chapter we shall suggest standard forms for such comparative analyses, and we shall also discuss the significance of the various items included therein. Needless to say, these forms are called “standard” only in the sense that they can be used generally to good advantage; no claim of perfection is made for them, and the student is free to make any changes that he thinks will serve his particular purpose.

**Observations on the Railroad Comparison.** In has formerly been the custom to base earnings studies on the figures for the previous calendar years, with certain references to later interim reports. But since complete figures are now available month by month, it is more logical and effective practice to ignore the calendar-year divisions and to use instead the results for the twelve months to the latest date available. The simplest way t arrive at such a twelve months’ figure is to apply the *change* shown for thecurrent year to date to the results of the previous calendar year.

*Example:*

##### Gross Earnings of Pennsylvania Railroad System for 12 Months Ended June, 1939

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>(1) 6 months to June 1939 (as reported)</td>
    <td>$189,623,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(2) 6 months to June 1938 (as reported)</td>
    <td>167,524,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(3) Difference</td>
    <td>+22,099,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(4) Calendar year 1938</td>
    <td>360,384,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12 months to June 1939 (4 plus 3)</td>
    <td>$382,483,000</td>
  </tr>

Our table includes a few significant calculations based on the seven-year average. In an intensive study, average results should be scrutinized in more detail. To save time, it is suggested that additional average figures be computed only for those roads which the analyst selects for further investigation after he has studied the exhibits in the “standard form.” Whether the period of averaging should cover seven years or a longer or shorter time is largely a matter for individual judgement. In theory it should be just long enough to cover a full cyclical fluctuation but not so long as to include factors or results that are totally out of date. The six years 1934—1939 might well be regarded as a somewhat better criterion, for example, than the longer period 1933—1939.
