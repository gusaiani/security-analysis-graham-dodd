### Specific Reasons for Questioning or Rejecting the Past Record

In analyzing an individual company, each of the governing elements in the operating results must be scrutinized for signs of possible unfavorable changes in the future. This procedure may be illustrated by various examples drawn from the mining field. The four governing elements in such situations would be: (1) life of the mine, (2) annual output, (3) production costs and (4) selling price. The significance of the first factor has already been discussed in connection with charges against earnings for depletion. Both the output and the costs may be affected adversely if the ore to be mined in the future differs from that previously mined in location, character or grade.

**Rate of Output and Operating Costs.** *Examples: Calumet and Hecla Consolidated Copper Company.* The reports of this copper producer for 1936 and previous years illustrate various questions with respect to ore reserves. The income account for 1936 may be summarized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper produced</td>
    <td>78,500,000 lb.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper sold</td>
    <td>95,200,000 lb. @ 9.80 cents</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Profit before depreciation and depletion</td>
    <td>$3,855,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Depreciation</td>
    <td>1,276,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Depletion</td>
    <td>1,726,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Earned per share after depreciation but before depletion on 2,006,000 shares</td>
    <td>$1.29</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Early in 1937 the stock sold at $20 per share, a valuation of $40,000,000 for the company, or $30,000,000 for the mining properties plus $10,000,000 for the working capital.

A detailed analysis of the make-up of the 1936 earnings would have shown them to be derived from four separate sources, approximately as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Source of copper</th>
    <th>Number of pounds, millions</th>
    <th>Profit before depreciation and depletion - Cents per pound (approximate)</th>
    <th>Profit before depreciation and depletion - Total (approximate)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper previously produced</td>
    <td>17.3</td>
    <td>4.5</td>
    <td>$775,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Conglomerate mine</td>
    <td>36.3</td>
    <td>3.6</td>
    <td>1,305,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ahmeek mine</td>
    <td>23.0</td>
    <td>3.3</td>
    <td>760,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reclamation plants</td>
    <td>19.2</td>
    <td>5.3</td>
    <td>1,015,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>95.8</td>
    <td>4.0</td>
    <td>$3,855,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Of these four sources of profit, all but the smallest were definitely limited in life. The sale of copper produced in prior years was obviously non-recurring. The mainstay of the company’s production for 70 years—the Conglomerate Branch—was facing exhaustion “in the course of 12 or 14 months.” The reclamation-plant copper, recovered by reworking old tailings and providing the cheapest metal, was limited to a life of 5 to 7 years. There remained as the only more permanent source of future output the Ahmeek Mine, which was the highest cost operation and which had therefore been shut down from April 1932 through 1935. (There were also certain other high-cost properties that were still shut down in 1936.)

Analysis would indicate, therefore, that probably not more than a total of some 7 to 8 millions in profit could be expected in the future from the Conglomerate and the reclamation operations. Hence, aside from new developments of a speculative character, the greater part of the 40 millions of valuation for the company would have to be supported by earnings from higher cost properties *which had contributed only a minor part of the 1936 results.*

*Freeport Sulphur Company.* The exhibit of the then Freeport Texas Company in 1933 supplies the same type of problem for the analyst, and it also raises the question of the propriety of the use, under such circumstances, of the past earnings record to support the sale of new securities. An issue of $2,500,000 of 6% cumulative convertible preferred stock was sold at $100 per share in January 1933 in order to raise funds to equip a new sulphur property leased from certain other companies.

The offering circular stated among other things:

1. That the sulphur reserves had an estimated life of at least 25 years based upon the average annual sales for 1928—1932;
2. That the earnings for the period 1928—1932 averaged $2,952,500, or 19.5 times the preferred-dividend requirement.

The implication of these statements would be that, assuming no change in the price received for sulphur, the company could confidently be expected to earn over the next 25 years approximately the amounts earned in the past.

The facts in the case, however, did not warrant any such deduction. The company’s past earnings were derived from the operation of two properties, at Bryanmound and at Hoskins Mound, respectively. The Bryanmound area was owned by the company and had contributed the bulk of the profits. But by 1933 its life was “definitely limited” (in the words of the listing application); *in fact the reserves were not likely to last more than about three years*. The Hoskins Mound was leased from the Texas Company. After paying $1.06 per ton fixed royalty, no less than 70% of the remaining profits were payable to Texas Company as rental. One half of Freeport’s sales were required to be made from sulphur produced at Hoskins. The new property at Grande Ecaille, La., now to be developed, would require royalty payments amounting to some 40% of the net earnings.

When these facts are studied, it will be seen that the earnings of Freeport Texas for 1928—1932 had no direct bearing on the results to be expected from future operations. The sulphur reserves, stated to be good for 25 years, represented mineral located in an entirely different place and to be extracted under entirely different conditions from those obtaining in the past. A large profit-sharing royalty would be payable on the sulphur produced from the new project, whereas the old Bryanmount was owned outright by Freeport and hence its profits accrued 100% to the company.

In addition to this known element of higher cost, great stress must be laid also upon the fact that the major future profits of Freeport were now expected from a *new project*. The Grande Ecaille property was not yet equipped and in operation, and hence it was subject to the many hazards that attach to enterprises in the development stage. The cost of production at the new mine might conceivably be much higher, or much lower, than at Bryanmound. From the standpoint of security analysis the important point is that, where two quite different properties are involved, you have two virtually separate enterprises. Hence the 1928—1932 record of Freeport Texas was hardly more relevant to its future history than were the figures of some entirely different sulphur company, *e.g.*, Texas Gulf Sulphur.

Returning once more to the business man’s viewpoint on security values, the Freeport Texas exhibit suggests the following interesting line of reasoning. In June 1933 this enterprise was selling in the market for about $32,000,000 (25,000 shares of preferred at 125 and 730,000 shares of common at 40). The major portion of its future profits were expected to be derived from an investment of $3,000,000 to equip a new property leased from three large oil companies. Presumably these oil companies drove as good a bargain for themselves as possible in the terms of the lease. The market was in effect placing a valuation of some $20,000,000, or more, upon a new enterprise in which only $3,000,000 was to be invested. It was possible, of course, that this enterprise would prove to be worth much more than six time the money put into it. But from the standpoint of ordinary business procedure the payment of such an enormous premium for anticipated future results would appear imprudent in the extreme.

Evidently the stock market—like the heart, in the French proverb—has reasons all its own. In the writer’s view, where these reasons depart violently from sound sense and business experience, common-stock buying must inevitably lose money in the end, even though large speculative gains may temporarily accrue, and even though certain fortunate purchases may turn out to be permanently profitable.

**The Future Price of the Product. **The three preceding examples related to the future continuance of the rate of output and the operating costs upon which the past record of earning was predicted. We must also consider such indications as may be available in regard to the *future selling price* of the product. Here we must ordinarily enter into the field of surmise or of prophecy. The analyst can truthfully say very little aobut future prices, except that they fall outside the realm of sound prediction. Now and then a more illuminating statement may be justified by the facts. Adhering to the mining field for our examples, we may mention the enormous profits made by zinc producers during the Great War, because of the high price of spelter. Butte and Superior Mining Company earned no less than $64 per share before depreciation and depletion in the two years 1915—1916, as the result of obtaining about 13 cents per pound for its output of zinc, against a prewar average of about 5¼ cents. Obviously the future earning power of this company was almost certain to shrink far below the war-time figures, nor could these properly be taken together with the results of any other years in order to arrive at the average or supposedly “normal“ earnings.
