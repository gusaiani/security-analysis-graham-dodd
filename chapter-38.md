### Specific Reasons for Questioning or Rejecting the Past Record

In analyzing an individual company, each of the governing elements in the operating results must be scrutinized for signs of possible unfavorable changes in the future. This procedure may be illustrated by various examples drawn from the mining field. The four governing elements in such situations would be: (1) life of the mine, (2) annual output, (3) production costs and (4) selling price. The significance of the first factor has already been discussed in connection with charges against earnings for depletion. Both the output and the costs may be affected adversely if the ore to be mined in the future differs from that previously mined in location, character or grade.

**Rate of Output and Operating Costs.** *Examples: Calumet and Hecla Consolidated Copper Company.* The reports of this copper producer for 1936 and previous years illustrate various questions with respect to ore reserves. The income account for 1936 may be summarized as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper produced</td>
    <td>78,500,000 lb.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper sold</td>
    <td>95,200,000 lb. @ 9.80 cents</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Profit before depreciation and depletion</td>
    <td>$3,855,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Depreciation</td>
    <td>1,276,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Depletion</td>
    <td>1,726,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Earned per share after depreciation but before depletion on 2,006,000 shares</td>
    <td>$1.29</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Early in 1937 the stock sold at $20 per share, a valuation of $40,000,000 for the company, or $30,000,000 for the mining properties plus $10,000,000 for the working capital.

A detailed analysis of the make-up of the 1936 earnings would have shown them to be derived from four separate sources, approximately as follows:
