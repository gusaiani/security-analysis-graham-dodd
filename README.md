# Security Analysis - Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd

In this repo I slowly retype Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis.

##### Chapter 1

## The Scope and Limitations of Security Analysis. The Concept of Intrinsic Value

Analysis conotes the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic. Is is part of the scientific method. But in applying analysis to the field of securities we encounter the serious obstacle that investment is by nature not an exact science. The same is true, however, of law and medicine, for here also both individual skill (art) and chance are important factors in determining success or failure. Nevertheless, in these professions analysis is not only useful but indispensable, so that the same should probably be true in the field of investment and possibly in that of speculation.

In the last three decades the prestige of security analysis in Wall Street has experienced both a brilliant rise and an ignominious fallâ€”a history related but by no means parallel to the course of stock prices.
