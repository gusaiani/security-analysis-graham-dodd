### Low-Priced Common Stocks. Analysis of the Source of Income

#### Low-Priced Stocks

The characteristics discussed in the preceding chapter are generally thought of by the public in connection with *low-priced stocks*. The majority of issues of the speculatively capitalized type do sell within the low-priced range. The definition of “low-priced” must, of course, be somewhat arbitrary. Prices below $10 per share belong to this cateogry beyond question; those above $20 are ordinarily excluded; so that the dividing line would be set somewhere between $10 and $20.

**Arithmetical Advantage of Low-priced Issues.** Low-priced common stocks appear to possess an inherent arithmetical advantage arising from the fact they can advance so much more than they can decline. It is a commonplace of the securities market that an issue will rise more readily from 10 to 40 than from 100 to 400. This fact is due in part to the preferences of the speculative public, which generally is much more partial to issues in the 10-to-40 range than to those selling above 100. But it is also true that in many cases low-price common stocks give the owner the advantage of an interest in, or “call” upon , a relatively large enterprise at relatively small expense.

A statistical study of the relative price behavior of industrial stocks in various price groups was presented in the April 1936 issue of *The Journal of Business of the University of Chicago*. The study was devoted to the period 1926—1935 and revealed a continuous superiority of diversified, low-priced issues over diversified, high-priced issues as speculative media. The following quotation from the study summarizes the results and conclusions reached by the author:

```
Unless there are serious uncompensated errors in the statistical work here presented, this investigation would seem to establish the existence of certain relationships between price level and price fluctuations which have hitherto gone unreported by students of stock-market phenomena. These relationships may be briefly stated as follows:

1. Low-price stocks tend to fluctuate relatively more than high-price stocks.

2. In a “bull” market the low-price stocks tend to go up relatively more than high-price stocks, and they do not lose these superior gains in the recessions which follow. In other words, the downward movement of low-price stocks is less than proportional to their upward movement, when compared with the upward and downward movement of high-price stocks.

*****

Assuming (1) that the future behavior of the various price groups will be similar to their past behavior and (2) that the selection of stocks on the basis of the activity for the current year does not account completely, if at all, for the superior preformance of the stocks in the low-price groups, it seems logical to conclude the following:

1. Low-priced industrial stocks offer greater opportunities for speculative profits than high-price industrial stocks.

2. In case two or more issues of industrial stocks seem to offer equal prospective profits, the speculator should purchase the shares selling at the lowest price.
```

**Some Reasons Why Most Buyers of Low-priced Issues Lose Money.** The pronounced liking of the public for “cheap stocks” would therefore seem to have a sound basis in logic. Yet it is undoubtedly true that most people who buy low-priced stocks lose money on their purchases. Why is this so? The underlying reason is that the public buys issues that are *sold* to it, and the sales effort is put forward to benefit the seller and not the buyer. In consequence the bulk of the low-priced purchases made by the public are of the wrong kind; *i.e.*, they do not provide the real advantages of this security type. The reason may be either because the company is in bad financial condition or because the common stock is low-priced in appearance only and actually represents a full or excessive commitment in relation to the size of the enterprise. The latter is preponderantly true of *new* security offerings in the low-priced range. In such cases, a *pseudo-low* price is accomplished by the simple artifice of creating so large a number of shares that even at a few dollars per share the total value of the common issue is excessive. This has been true of mining-stock flotations from of old and was encountered again in the liquor-stock offerings of 1933 and in the airplane issues in 1938—1939.

A *genuinely* low-priced common stock will show an aggregate value for the issue which is small in relation to the company’s assets, sales and past or prospective profits. The examples shown herewith will illustrate the difference between a ”genuine” and ”pseudo-low” price.

The Wright-Hargreaves issue was low-priced in appearance only, for in fact the price registered a very high valuation for the company as compared with all parts of its financial exhibit. The opposite was true of Barker Brothers because here the $743,000 valuation represented by the common stock was exceedingly small in relation to the size of the enterprise. (Note also that the same statement could be applied to Barker Brothers Preferred, which at its quotation of 18 partook of the qualities of a low-priced common stock.)

Observation of the stock market will show that the stocks of companies facing receivership are likely to be more active than those which are very low in price merely because of poor current earnings. This phenomenon is caused by the desire of insiders to dispose of their holdings before the receivership wipes them out, thus accounting for a large supply of these shares at a low level and also sometimes for unscrupulous efforts to persuade the unwary public to buy them. But where a low-priced stock fulfills our conditions of speculative attractiveness, there is apt to be no pressure to sell and no effort to create buying. Hence the issue is inactive and attracts little public attention. This analysis may explain why the public almost always buys the wrong low-priced issues and ignores the really promising opportunities in this field.

**Low Price Coupled with Speculative Capitalization.** Speculatively capitalized enterprises, according to our definition, are marked by a relatively large amount of senior securities and a comparatively small issue of common stock. Although in most cases the common stock will sell at a low price per share, it need not necessarily do so if the number of shares is small. In the Staley case, for example (referred to on pp. 515—516) even at $50 per share for the common in 1933 the capitalization structure would still have been speculative, since the bonds and preferred at par would represent over 90% of the total. It is also true that even where there are no senior securities the common stock may have possibilities equivalent to those in a speculatively capitalized enterprise. These possibilities will occur wherever the market value of the common issue represents a small amount of money in relation to the size of the business, regardless of how it is capitalized.

To illustrate this point we append a condensed analysis of Mandel Brothers, Inc., and Gimbel Brothers, Inc., two department-store enterprises, as of September 1939.

Gimbel Brothers presents a typical picture of a speculatively capitalized enterprise. On the other hand Mandel Brothers has no senior securities ahead of the comon, but despite this fact the relatively sall market value of the entire issue imparts to the shares the same sort of speculative possibilities (though in somewhat lesser degree) as are found in the Gimel Brothers set-up. Note, however, that the rental payments of Mandel Brothers, are proportionately much higher than those of Gimbel Brothers and that these rental charges are equivalent in good part to senior securities.

**Large Volume and High Production Cost Equivalent to Speculative Capital Structure.** This example should lead us to widen our conception of a speculatively situated common stock. The speculative or *marginal* position may arise from any cause that reduces the percentage of gross available for the common to a subnormal figure and that therefore serves to create a subnormal value for the common stock in relation to the volume of business. Unusually high operating or production costs have the identical effect as excessive senior charges in cutting down the percentage of gross available for common. The following hypothetical examples of three copper producers will make this point more intelligible and also lead to some conclusions on the subject of large output versus low operating costs.

It is scarcely necessary to point out that the higher production cost of Company *C* will have exactly the same effect as the bond-interest requirement of Company *B* (assuming output and production costs to continue as stated).

*General Principle Derived.* The foregoing table is perhaps more useful in showing concretely the inverse relationship that usually exists between profit per unit and output per dollar of stock value.

The general principle may be stated that the lower the unit cost the lower the production per dollar of market value of stock and *vice versa*. Since Company *A* has a 7-cent cost, its stock naturally sells at a higher price *per pound of output* than Company *C* with its 9-cent cost. Conversely, Company *C* produces more pounds per dollar of stock value than Company *A*. This fact is not without significance from the standpoint of speculative technique. When a rise in the price of the commodity occurs, there will ordinarily be a larger advance, percentagewise, in the shares of high-cost producers than in the shares of low-cost producers. The foregoing table indicates that a rise in the price of copper from 10 to 13 cents would increase the value of Company *A* shares by 100% and the value of Company *B* and *C* shares by 300%. Contrary to the general impression in Wall Street, the stocks of high-cost producers are more logical commitments than those of the low-cost producers when the buyer is convinced that a rise in the price of the product is imminent and he wishes to exploit this conviction to the utmost. Exactly the same advantage attaches to the purchase of speculatively capitalized common stocks when a pronouced improvement in sales and profits is confidently anticipated.

### The Sources of Income

The “source of income” will ordinarily be thought of as meaning the same thing as the “type of business.” This consideration enters very largely into the basis on which the public will value the earnings per share shown by a given common stock. Different “multipliers” are used for different sorts of enterprise, but we must point out that these distinctions are themselves subject to change with the changing times. Prior to the World War the railroad stocks were valued most generously of all, because of their supposed stability. In 1927—1929 the public-utility group sold at the highest ratio to earnings, because of their record of steady growth. Between 1933 and 1939 adverse legislation and, in particular, the fear of goverment competition greatly reduced the relative popularity of the utility stocks. the most liberal valuations have recently been accorded to the large and well-entrenched industrial enterprises which were able to maintain substantial earnings during the depression and are considered to possess favorable long-term prospects. Because of these repeated variations in relative behavior and popularity, security analysis must hesitate to prescribe any definitive rules for valuing one type of business as against another. It is a truism to say that the more impressive the record and the more promising the prospects of stability and growth the more liberally the per-share earnings should be valued, subject always to our principle that a multiplier higher than about 20 (*i.e.,* an “earnings basis” of less than 5%) will carry the issue out of the *investment* price range.

**A Special Phase: Three Examples.** A more fruitful field for the technique of analysis is found in those cases where the source of income must be studied in relation to specific assets owned by the company, instead of in relation merely to the general nature of the business. This point may be quite important when a substantial portion of the income accrues from investment holdings or from some other fixed and dependable source. Three examples will be used to illuminate this rather subtle aspect of common-stock analysis.

1. *Northern Pipe Line Company.* For the years 1923—1925 the Northern Pipe Line Company reported earnings and dividends as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Year</th>
    <th>Net earnings</th>
    <th>Earned per share</th>
    <th>Dividend paid</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1923</td>
    <td>$308,000</td>
    <td>$7.70</td>
    <td>$10, plus $15 extra</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1924</td>
    <td>214,000</td>
    <td>5.35</td>
    <td>8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1925</td>
    <td>311,000</td>
    <td>7.77</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In 1924 the shares sold as low as 72, in 1925 as low as 67½ and in 1926 as low as 64. These prices were on the whole somewhat less than ten times the reported earnings and reflected a lack of enthusiasm for the shares, due to a pronounced decline in profits from the figures of preceding years and also to the reductions in the dividend.

Analysis of the income account however, would have revealed the following division of the *sources of income:*

This income account is exceptional in that the greater part of the profits were derived from sources other than the pipe-line business itself. About $4 per share were regularly received in interest on investments and rentals. The balance sheet showed holdings of nearly $3,200,000 (or $80 per share) in Liberty Bonds and other gilt-edged marketable securities, on which the enterest income was about 4%.
