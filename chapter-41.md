#### Low-Priced Stocks

The characteristics discussed in the preceding chapter are generally thought of by the public in connection with *low-priced stocks*. The majority of issues of the speculatively capitalized type do sell within the low-priced range. The definition of “low-priced” must, of course, be somewhat arbitrary. Prices below $10 per share belong to this cateogry beyond question; those above $20 are ordinarily excluded; so that the dividing line would be set somewhere between $10 and $20.
