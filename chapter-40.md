### Capitalization Structure

The division of a company’s total capitalization between senior securities and common stock has an important bearing upon the significance of the earning power per share. A set of hypothetical examples will help make this point clear. For this purpose we shall postulate three industrial companies, *A, **B* and *C*, each with an earning power (*i.e.*, with average and recent earnings) of $1,000,000. They are identical in all respects save capitalization structure. Company *A* is capitalized solely at 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *B* has outstanding $6,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *C* has outstanding $12,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock.

We shall assume that the bonds are worth par and that the common stocks are worth about 12 times their per-share earnings. Then the value of the three companies will work out as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Earnings for common stock</th>
    <th>Value of common stock</th>
    <th>Value of bonds</th>
    <th>Total value of company</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>760,000</td>
    <td>9,000,000</td>
    <td>$6,000,000</td>
    <td>15,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>520,000</td>
    <td>6,000,000</td>
    <td>12,000,000</td>
    <td>18,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These results challenge attention. Companies with identical earning power appear to have widely differing values, due solely to the arrangement of their capitalization. But the capitalization structure is itself a matter of voluntary determinaton by those in control. Does this mean that the fair value of an enterprise can be arbitrarily increased or decreased by changing around the relative proportions of senior securities and common stock?

**Can the Value of an Enterprise Be Altered through Arbitrary Variations in Capital Structure?** To answer this question properly we must scrutinize our examples with greater care. In working out the value of the three companies we assumed that the bonds would be worth par and that the stocks would be worth twelve times their earnings. Are these assumptions tenable? Let us consider first the case of Company *B*. If there are no unfavorable elements in the picture, the bonds might well sell at about 100, since the interest is earned four times. Nor would the presence of this funded debt ordinarily prevent the common stock from selling at 12 times its established earning power.

It will be urged however, that, if Company *B* shares are worth 12 times their earnings, Company *A* shares should be worth more than this multiple because they have no debt ahead of them. The risk is therefore smaller, and they are less vulnerable to the effect of a shrinkage in earnings than is the stock of Company *B*. This is obviously true, and yet it is equally true that Company *B* shares will be more responsive to an *increase* in earnings. The following figures bring this point out clearly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Assumed earnings</th>
    <th>Company A — Earned per share</th>
    <th>Company B — Earned per share</th>
    <th>Company A — Change in earnings per share from base</th>
    <th>Company B — Change in earnings per share from base</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
    <td>$10.00</td>
    <td>$7.60</td>
    <td>(Base)</td>
    <td>(Base)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <tr>
    <td>750,000</td>
    <td>7.50</td>
    <td>5.10</td>
    <td>—25%</td>
    <td>-33%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1,250,000</td>
    <td>12.50</td>
    <td>10.100</td>
    <td>+25%</td>
    <td>+33%</td>
  </tr>

Would it not be fair to assume that the greater sensitivity of Company *B* to a possible decline in profits is offset by its greater sensitivity to a possible increase? Furthermore, if the investor expects higher earnings in future—and presumably he selects his common stocks with this in mind‚ would he not be justified in selecting the issue that will benefit more from a given degree of improvement? We are thus led back to the original conclusions that Company *B* may be worth $3,000,000, or 25% more than Company *A* due solely to its distribution of capitalization between bonds and stock.

**Principle of Optimum Capitalization Structure.** Paradoxical as this conclusion may seem, it is supposed by the actual behaviour of common stocks in the market. If we subject this contradiction to closer analysis, we shall find that it arises from what may be called an *oversimplification* of Company *A*‘s capital structure. Company *A*’s common stock evidently contains the two elements represented by the bonds and stock of Company *B*. Part of Company *A*’s stock is at bottom equivalent to Company *B*’s bonds and should *in theory* be valued on the same basis, *i.e.*, 4%. The remainder of Company *A*’s stock should then be valued at 12 times earnings. This theoretical reasoning would give us a combined value of $15,000,000, *i.e.*, an average 6 2/3% basis, for the two components of Company *A* stock, which, of course, is the same as that of Company *B* bonds and stock taken together.

But this $15,000,000 value for Company *A* stock would not ordinarily be realized *in practice*. The obvious reason is that the common-stock buyer will rarely recognize the existence of a “bond component” in a common-stock issue, and in any event, not wanting such a bond component, he is unwilling to pay extra for it. This fact leads us to an important principle, both for the security buyer and for corporate management, *viz.*:

*The optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes senior securities to the extent that they may safely be issue and and bought for investment.*

Concretely this means that the capitalization arrangement of Company *B* is preferable to that of Company *A* from the stockholder’s standpoint, assuming that in both cases the $6,000,000 bond issue would constitute a sound investment. (This might require, among other things, that the companies show a net working capital of not less than $6,000,000 in accordance with the stringent tests for sound industrial issues recommended in Chap. 13, which is on accompanying CD.) Under such conditions the contribution of the entire capital by the common stockholders may be called an *over*-conservative set-up, as it tends generally to make the stockholder’s dollar less productive to him than if a reasonable part of the capital were borrowed. An analogous situation holds true in most private businesses, where it is recognized as profitable and proper policy to use a conservative amount of banking accommodation for seasonal needs rather than to finance operations entirely by owner’s capital.

**Corporate Practices Resulting in Shortage of Sound Industrial Bonds.** Furthermore, just as it is desirable from the bank’s standpoint that sound businesses borrow seasonally, it is also desirable from the standpoint of investors generally that strong industrial corporations raise an appropriate part of their capital through the sale of bonds. Such a policy would increase the number of high-grade bond issues on the market, giving the bond investor a wider range of choice and making it deservedly difficult to sell unsound bonds. Unfortunately the practice of industrial corporations in recent years has tended to produce a shortage of good industrial bond issues. Strong enterprises have in general refrained from floating new bonds and in many cases have retired old ones. But this avoidance of bonded debt by the strongest industrial companies has in fact produced results demoralizing to investors and investment policies in a number of ways. The following observations on this point, written in 1934, are still applicable in good part:

1. It has tended to restrict new industrial-bond financing to companies of weaker standing. The relative scarcity of good bonds impelled investment houses to sell and investors to buy inferior issues, with inevitably disastrous results.

2. The shortage of good bonds also tended to drive investors into the preferred-stock field. For reasons previously detailed (in Chap. XIV) straight preferred stocks are unsound in theory, and they are therefore likely to prove unsatisfactory investment media as a class.

3. The elimination (or virtual elimination) of senior securities in the set-up of many large corporations has, of course, added somewhat to the investment quality of their common stocks, but it has added even more to the investor’s demand for these common stocks. This in turn has resulted in a good deal of common-stock buying by people whose circumstances required that they purchase sound bonds.
