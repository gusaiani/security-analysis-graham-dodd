##### Chapter 40

### Capitalization Structure

The division of a companyâ€™s total capitalization between senior securities and common stock has an important bearing upon the significance of the earning power per share. A set of hypothetical examples will help make this point clear. For this purpose we shall postulate three industrial companies, *A, **B* and *C*, each with an earning power (*i.e.*, with average and recent earnings) of $1,000,000. They are identical in all respects save capitalization structure. Company *A* is capitalized solely at 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *B* has outstanding $6,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *C* has outstanding $12,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock.

We shall assume that the bonds are worth par and that the common stocks are worth about 12 times their per-share earnings. Then the value of the three companies will work out as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Earnings for common stock</th>
    <th>Value of common stock</th>
    <th>Value of bonds</th>
    <th>Total value of company</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>760,000</td>
    <td>9,000,000</td>
    <td>$6,000,000</td>
    <td>15,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>520,000</td>
    <td>6,000,000</td>
    <td>12,000,000</td>
    <td>18,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These results challenge attention. Companies with identical earning power appear to have widely differing values, due solely to the arrangement of their capitalization. But the capitalization structure is itself a matter of voluntary determinaton by those in control. Does this mean that the fair value of an enterprise can be arbitrarily increased or decreased by changing around the relative proportions of senior securities and common stock?
