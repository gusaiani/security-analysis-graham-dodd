##### Chapter 40

### Capitalization Structure

The division of a company’s total capitalization between senior securities and common stock has an important bearing upon the significance of the earning power per share. A set of hypothetical examples will help make this point clear. For this purpose we shall postulate three industrial companies, *A, **B* and *C*, each with an earning power (*i.e.*, with average and recent earnings) of $1,000,000. They are identical in all respects save capitalization structure. Company *A* is capitalized solely at 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *B* has outstanding $6,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *C* has outstanding $12,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock.

We shall assume that the bonds are worth par and that the common stocks are worth about 12 times their per-share earnings. Then the value of the three companies will work out as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company</th>
    <th>Earnings for common stock</th>
    <th>Value of common stock</th>
    <th>Value of bonds</th>
    <th>Total value of company</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>$12,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>760,000</td>
    <td>9,000,000</td>
    <td>$6,000,000</td>
    <td>15,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>520,000</td>
    <td>6,000,000</td>
    <td>12,000,000</td>
    <td>18,000,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These results challenge attention. Companies with identical earning power appear to have widely differing values, due solely to the arrangement of their capitalization. But the capitalization structure is itself a matter of voluntary determinaton by those in control. Does this mean that the fair value of an enterprise can be arbitrarily increased or decreased by changing around the relative proportions of senior securities and common stock?

**Can the Value of an Enterprise Be Altered through Arbitrary Variations in Capital Structure?** To answer this question properly we must scrutinize our examples with greater care. In working out the value of the three companies we assumed that the bonds would be worth par and that the stocks would be worth twelve times their earnings. Are these assumptions tenable? Let us consider first the case of Company *B*. If there are no unfavorable elements in the picture, the bonds might well sell at about 100, since the interest is earned four times. Nor would the presence of this funded debt ordinarily prevent the common stock from selling at 12 times its established earning power.

It will be urged however, that, if Company *B* shares are worth 12 times their earnings, Company *A* shares should be worth more than this multiple because they have no debt ahead of them. The risk is therefore smaller, and they are less vulnerable to the effect of a shrinkage in earnings than is the stock of Company *B*. This is obviously true, and yet it is equally true that Company *B* shares will be more responsive to an *increase* in earnings. The following figures bring this point out clearly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Assumed earnings</th>
    <th>Company A — Earned per share</th>
    <th>Company B — Earned per share</th>
    <th>Company A — Change in earnings per share from base</th>
    <th>Company B — Change in earnings per share from base</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
    <td>$10.00</td>
    <td>$7.60</td>
    <td>(Base)</td>
    <td>(Base)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <tr>
    <td>750,000</td>
    <td>7.50</td>
    <td>5.10</td>
    <td>—25%</td>
    <td>-33%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1,250,000</td>
    <td>12.50</td>
    <td>10.100</td>
    <td>+25%</td>
    <td>+33%</td>
  </tr>

  Would it not be fair to assume that the greater sensitivity of Company *B* to a possible decline in profits is offset by its greater sensitivity to a possible increase? Furthermore, if the investor expects higher earnings in future—and presumably he selects his common stocks with this in mind‚ would he not be justified in selecting the issue that will benefit more from a given degree of improvement? We are thus led back to the original conclusions that Company *B* may be worth $3,000,000, or 25% more than Company *A* due solely to its distribution of capitalization between bonds and stock.
