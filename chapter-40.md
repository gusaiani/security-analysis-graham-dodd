##### Chapter 40

### Capitalization Structure

The division of a companyâ€™s total capitalization between senior securities and common stock has an important bearing upon the significance of the earning power per share. A set of hypothetical examples will help make this point clear. For this purpose we shall postulate three industrial companies, *A, **B* and *C*, each with an earning power (*i.e.*, with average and recent earnings) of $1,000,000. They are identical in all respects save capitalization structure. Company *A* is capitalized solely at 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *B* has outstanding $6,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock. Company *C* has outstanding $12,000,000 of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock.
