### Technical Characteristics of Privileged Senior Securities

In the preceding chapter privileged senior issues were considered in their relationship to the broader principles of investment and speculation. To arrive at an adequate knowlegde of this group of securities from their practical side, a more intensive discussion of their characteristitc is now in order. Such a study may conveniently be carried on from three successive viewpoints: (1) considerations common to all three types of privilege—conversion, participation, and subscription (*i.e.*, “warrant”); (2) the relative merits of each type, as compared with the others; (3) technical aspects of each type, considered by itself.

#### Considerations Generally Applicable to Privileged Issues

The attractiveness of a profit-sharing feature depends upon two major but entirely unrelated factors: (1) the *terms* of the arrangement and (2) the *prospects* of profits to share. To use a simple illustration:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Company A</th>
    <th>Company B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4% bond selling at 100</td>
    <td>4% bond selling at 100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Convertible into stock at 50 (i.e., two shares of stock for a $100 bond)</td>
    <td>Convertible into stock at 33 1/3 (i.e., three shares of stock for a $100 bond)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stock selling at 30</td>
    <td>Stock selling at 30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Terms of the Privilege vs. Prospects for the Enterprise.** The *terms* of the conversion privilege are evidently more attractive in the case of Bond *B*; for the stock need advance only a little more than 3 points to assure a profit, whereas Stock *A* must advance over 20 points to make conversion profitable. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that Bond *A* may turn out to be the more advantageous purchase. For conceivably Stock *B* may fail to advance at all while Stock *A* may double or triple in price.

As between the two factors, it is undoubtedly true that it is more profitable to select the right *company* than to select the issue with the most desirable *terms*. There is certainly no mathematical basis on which the attractiveness of the enterprise may be offset against the terms of the privilege, and a balance struck between these two entirely dissociated elements of value.
