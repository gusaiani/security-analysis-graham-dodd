# Distinctions Between Investment and Speculation

**General Connotations of the Term “Investment.”** Investment or investing, like “value” in the famous dictum of Justice Brandeis, is “a word of many meanings.” Of these, three will concern us here. The first meaning, or set of meanings, relates to putting or having money in a business. A man “invests” $1,000 in opening a grocery store; the “return on investment” in the steel industry (including bonded debt and retained profits) averaged 2.40% during 1929–1938. The sense here is purely descriptive; it makes no distinctions and pronounces no judgements. Note, however, that it accepts rather than rejects the element of risk–the ordinary business investment is said to be made “at the risk of the business”.
