### Protective Covenants and Remedies of Senior Security Holders

In this and the two succeeding chapters we shall consider the provisions usually made to protect the rights of bond owners and preferred stockholders against impairment, and the various lines of action which may be followed in the event of nonfulfillment of the company’s obligations. Our object here, as throughout this book, is not to supply information of a kind readily available elsewhere, but rather to subject current practices to critical examination and to suggest feasible improvements therein for the benefit of security holders generally. In this connection a review of recent developments in the field of reorganization procedure may also be fould of value.

**Indenture or Charter Provisions Designed to Protect Holders of Senior Securities.** The contract between a corporation and the owners of its bonds is contained in a document called the *indenture or deed of trust*. The corresponding agreements relating to the rights of preferred stockholders are set forth in the Articles, or Certificate, of Incorporation. These instruments usually contain provisions designed to prevent corporate acts injurious to senior security holders and to afford remedies in case of certain unfavorable developments. The more important occurrences for which such provision is almost always made may be listed under the following heads:

<ol>
  <li>
    In the case of bonds:
    <ol>
      <li>Nonpayment of interest, principal, or sinking fund.</li>
      <li>Default on other obligations, or receivership.</li>
      <li>Issuance of new secured debt.</li>
      <li>Dilution of a conversion (or subscription) privilege.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the case of preferred stocks:
    <li>Nonpayment of (cumulative) preferred dividends for a period of time.</li>
    <li>Creation of funded debt or a prior stock issue.</li>
    <li>Dilution of a conversion (or subscription)privilege.</li>
  </li>
</ol>

A frequent, but less general, provision requires the maintenance of working capital at a certain percentage of the bonded debt of industrial companies. (In the case of investment-trust or holding-company bonds it is the *market value* of all the assets which is subject to this provision.)

The remedies provided for bondholders in cases falling under 1*a* and 1*b* above are fairly well standardized. Any one of these untoward developments is designated as an “event of default” and permits the trustee to declare the principal of the bond issue due and payable in advance of the specified maturity date. The provisions therefor in the indenture are known as “acceleration clauses.” Their purpose in the main is to enable the bondholders to assert the full amount of their claim in competition with the other creditors.

**Contradictory Aspects of Bondholders’ Legal Rights.** In considering these provisions from a critical standpoint, we must recognize that there are contradictory aspects to the question of the bondholders’ legal rights. Receivership is a dreaded word in Wall Street; its advent means ordinarily a drastic shrinkage in the price of all the company’s securities, including the bonds for the “benefit” of which the receivership was instituted. As we pointed out in a former chapter, the market’s appraisal of a bond in default is no higher on the whole, and perhaps lower, than that of a non-dividend-paying preferred stock of a solvent company.

The question arises, therefore, whether the bondholders might not be better off if they did not have any enforceable claim to principal or interest payments *when conditions are such as to make prompt payment impossible*. For at such times the bondholder’s legal rights apparently succeed only in ruining the corporation without benefiting the bondholder. As long as the interest or principal is not going to be paid anyway, would it not be to the interest of the bondholders themselves to postpone the date of payment and keep the enterprises out of the courts?

**Corporate Insolvency and Reorganization.** This question leads into the broad field of corporate insolvency and reorganization. We must try, within as brief a space as possible, first, to describe the procedure followed prior to the amendatory legistlation beginning in 1933; secondly, to summarize the changes brouht about by the recent statutes and, finally, to evaluate the bondholder’s position as it now appears. (The latter will be especially difficult, since the new laws have not yet had time to prove their merits or deficiencies in actual practice.)

The old pattern for corporate reorganizatin went usually as follows: Inability to pay interest or principal of indebtedness led to an application by the corporation itself for a receiver. It was customary to select a “friendly” court; the receiver was generally the company’s president; the bondholders’ interests were represented by protective committees ordinarily formed by the investment banking houses that had floated the issues. A reorganization plan was agreed upon by the committees and then approved by the court. The plan usually represented a compromise of the conflicting interests of the various ranks of security holders, under which, generally speaking, everyone retained *some* interest in the new company and everyone made some sacrifice.
