### Extraordinary Losses and Other Special Items in the Income Account

The question of nonrecurrent losses is likely to create peculiar difficulties in the analysis of income accounts. To what extent should write-downs of inventories and receivables be regarded as extraordinary deductions not fairly chargeable against the year’s operating results? In the disastrous year 1932 such charge-offs were made by nearly every business. The accounting methods used showed wide divergences, but the majority of companies spared their income accounts as much as possible and subtracted these losses from surplus. On the other hand the milder inventory losses of the 1937—1938 recession were almost universally charged into the earnings statement.

Inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business and are, therefore, by no means extraordinary in their general character. The collapse of inventory values in 1931—1932 might be considered extraordinary in its *extent*, in the same way as the business results as a whole were exceptional. It follows from this reasoning that if the 1931—1932 results are taken into account at all, *e.g.*, in computing a long-term average, all losses on inventories and receivables must be considered part of the operating deficit of those years even though charged to surplus. In Chap. 37 we shall consider the role of extraordinary years in determining the average earning power.

**Manufactured Earnings.** An examination of the wholesale charges made against surplus by American Machine and Metals, detailed on page 422, suggests the possibility that *excessive* provision for losses may have been made in that year with the intention of benefiting future income accounts. If the receivables and inventories were written down to an unduly low figure on December 31, 1932, this artificially low “cost price” would give rise to a correspondingly inflated profit in the following years. This point may be made clear by the use of hypothetical figures as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Assume fair value of inventory and receivables on Dec. 31, 1932 to be</td>
    <td>$2,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assume profit for 1933 based on such fair value</td>
    <td>200,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>But assume that, by special and excessive charges to surplus, then inventory and receivables had been written down to</td>
    <td>1,600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Then the amounts realized therefrom will show a correspondingly greater profit for 1933, which might mean *reported* earnings for 1933 of</td>
    <td>600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This would be three times the proper figure.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The foregoing example illustrates a whole set of practices that constitute perhaps the most vicious type of accounting manipulation. They consist, in brief, of taking sums out of surplus (or even capital) and then reporting these same sums as income. The charge to surplus goes unnoticed; the credit to income may have a determining influence upon the market price of the securities of the company. We shall later point out the “conservative” writing down of the property account has precisely this result, in that it permits a decreased depreciation charge and hence an increase in the apparent earnings. The dangers inherent in accounting methods of this sort are the more serious because they are so little realized by the public, so difficult to detect even by the expert analyst and so impervious to legislative or stock-exchange correction.

The basing of common-stock values on reported per-share earnings has made it much easier for managements to exercise an arbitrary and unwholesome control over the price of their shares. Whereas it should be emphasized that the overwhelming majority of managements are honest, it must be emphasized also that loose or “purposive” accounting is a highly contagious disease.

**Reserves for Inventory Losses.** The accounting for inventory losses is frequently complicated by the use of reserves set up before the loss is actually realized. These reserves are usually created by a charge to surplus, on the theory that it is a function of the surplus account to act as a sort of contingency reserve to absorb unusual future losses. If later the inventory shrinkage actually takes place, it is naturally charged against the reserve already created to meet it. The result is that in *no year* does the income account reflect the inventory loss, although it is just as much a hazard of operations as a decline in selling prices. When a company charges inventory losses to surplus—whether directly or through the intermediary of a reserve device—the analyst must take this practice carefully into account, especially in comparing the published results with those of other companies. A good illustration of this rule is afforded by a comparison of the reports submitted by United States Rubber Company and by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for the years 1925-1927, during which time rubber prices were subject to wide fluctuations.

In these three years Goodyear charged against *earnings* a total of $11,500,000 as reserves against decline of raw-material prices. Of this amount one-half was used to absorb actual losses sustained and the other half was carried forward into 1928 (and eventually used up in 1930).

United States Rubber during this period charged a total of $20,446,000 for inventory reserves and write-downs, all of which was absorbed by actual losses taken. But the form af annual statement, as submitted to the stockholders, excluded these deductions from income and made them appear as special adjustments of surplus. (In 1927, moreover, the inventory loss of $8,910,000 was apparently offset by a special credit of $8,000,000 from the transfer of *past* earnings of the crude-rubber producing subsidiary.)

The result of these divergent bases of reporting annual income was that the per-share earnings of the two companies, as compiled by the statistical manuals, made an entirely misleading comparative exhibit. The following per-share earnings are taken from *Poor’s Manual* for 1928:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Year</th>
    <th>U.S. Rubber</th>
    <th>Goodyear</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1925</td>
    <td>$14.92</td>
    <td>$9.45</td>

    <td>10.54</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3-year average</td>
    <td>$8.91</td>
    <td>$7.42</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For proper comparative purposes the statements must manifestly be considered on an identical basis, or as close thereto as possible. Such a comparison might be made by three possible methods, *viz.:*

1. As reported by United States Rubber, *i.e.*, excluding inventory reserves and losses from the current income account.

2. As reported by Goodyear, *i.e.*, reducing the earnings of the period of high prices for crude rubber by a reserve for future losses and using this reserve to absorb the later shrinkage.

3. Eliminating such reserves, as an arbitrary effort of the management to level out the earnings. On this basis the inventory losses would be deducted from the results of the year in which they were actually sustained. (The Standard Statistics Company’s analysis of Goodyear includes a revision of the reported earnings in conformity with this approach.)

  We have then, for comparative purposes, three statements of the per-share earnings for the period:

The range of market prices for the two common issues during this period suggest that the accounting methods followed by the United States Rubber served rather effectively to obscure the unsatisfactory nature of its results for these years.

More recently United States Rubber has followed the Goodyear pracice of taking out of the earnings of prosperous years a reserve for future inventory shrinkage. As a result of this policy, the company somewhat understated its earnings for 1935 and 1936 but overstated them for 1937.

*A More Recent Contrast.* The packing industry supplies us with a more extreme divergence in the method used by two companies to handle the matter of probable future inventory losses.

Wilson and Company set up a reserve of $750,000 prior to the beginning of its 1934 fiscal year, for “Fluctuation in Inventory Valuation.” This was taken partly from surplus and partly from income. In 1934 it reduced its opening inventory by this reserve, thus increasing the year’s reported profit by $750,000. The S.E.C., however, required it to amend its registration statement so as to credit this amount to surplus and not to income.

On the other hand, Swift and Company reduced its reported earnings in the fiscal years 1933-1935 by $16,767,000, which was set up as a reserve for future inventory decline. In 1938 the expected decline occurred; but instead of drawing on this reserve to spare the income account, the company charged the full loss against the year’s operations and then transferred $11,000,000 of the reserve directly to surplus. In this exceptional case the net income for the six-year period of 1933–1938 was *understated,* since amounts were actually taken out of income and turned over to surplus.
