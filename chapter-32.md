### Extraordinary Losses and Other Special Items in the Income Account

The question of nonrecurrent losses is likely to create peculiar difficulties in the analysis of income accounts. To what extent should write-downs of inventories and receivables be regarded as extraordinary deductions not fairly chargeable against the year’s operating results? In the disastrous year 1932 such charge-offs were made by nearly every business. The accounting methods used showed wide divergences, but the majority of companies spared their income accounts as much as possible and subtracted these losses from surplus. On the other hand the milder inventory losses of the 1937—1938 recession were almost universally charged into the earnings statement.

Inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business and are, therefore, by no means extraordinary in their general character. The collapse of inventory values in 1931—1932 might be considered extraordinary in its *extent*, in the same way as the business results as a whole were exceptional. It follows from this reasoning that if the 1931—1932 results are taken into account at all, *e.g.*, in computing a long-term average, all losses on inventories and receivables must be considered part of the operating deficit of those years even though charged to surplus. In Chap. 37 we shall consider the role of extraordinary years in determining the average earning power.

**Manufactured Earnings.** An examination of the wholesale charges made against surplus by American Machine and Metals, detailed on page 422, suggests the possibility that *excessive* provision for losses may have been made in that year with the intention of benefiting future income accounts. If the receivables and inventories were written down to an unduly low figure on December 31, 1932, this artificially low “cost price” would give rise to a correspondingly inflated profit in the following years. This point may be made clear by the use of hypothetical figures as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Assume fair value of inventory and receivables on Dec. 31, 1932 to be</td>
    <td>$2,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assume profit for 1933 based on such fair value</td>
    <td>200,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>But assume that, by special and excessive charges to surplus, then inventory and receivables had been written down to</td>
    <td>1,600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Then the amounts realized therefrom will show a correspondingly greater profit for 1933, which might mean *reported* earnings for 1933 of</td>
    <td>600,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This would be three times the proper figure.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The foregoing example illustrates a whole set of practices that constitute perhaps the most vicious type of accounting manipulation. They consist, in brief, of taking sums out of surplus (or even capital) and then reporting these same sums as income. The charge to surplus goes unnoticed; the credit to income may have a determining influence upon the market price of the securities of the company. We shall later point out the “conservative” writing down of the property account has precisely this result, in that it permits a decreased depreciation charge and hence an increase in the apparent earnings. The dangers inherent in accounting methods of this sort are the more serious because they are so little realized by the public, so difficult to detect even by the expert analyst and so impervious to legislative or stock-exchange correction.

The basing of common-stock values on reported per-share earnings has made it much easier for managements to exercise an arbitrary and unwholesome control over the price of their shares. Whereas it should be emphasized that the overwhelming majority of managements are honest, it must be emphasized also that loose or “purposive” accounting is a highly contagious disease.
