# Classification of Securities

Securities are customarily divided into the two main groups of bonds and stocks, with the latter subdivided into preferred stocks and common stocks. The first and basic division recognizes and conforms to the fundamental legal distinction between the creditors’ position and the partners’ position. The bondholder has a fixed and prior claim for principal and interest; the stockholder assumes the major risks and shares in the profits of ownership. It follows that a higher degree of safety should inhere in bonds as a class, while greater opportunity of speculative gain—to offset the greater hazard—is to be found in the field of stocks. It is this contrast, of both legal status and investment character, as between the two kinds of issues, which provides the point of departure for the usual textbook treatment of securities.

**Objections to the Conventional Grouping: 1. Preferred Stock Grouped with Common.** While this approach is hallowed by tradition, it is open to several serious objections. Of these the most obvious is that it places preferred stocks with common stocks, whereas, so far as investment practice is concerned, the former undoubtedly belong with bonds. The typical or standard preferred stock is bought for fixed income and safety of principal. Its owner considers himself not as a partner in the business but as the holder of a claim ranking ahead of the interest of the partners, *i.e.*, the common stockholders. Preferred stockholders are partners or owners of the business only in a technical, legalistic sense; but they resemble bondholders in the purpose and expected results of their investment; but they resemble bondholders in the purpose and expected results of their investment.

**2. Bond Form Identified with Safety.** A weightier though less patent objection to the radical separation of bonds from stocks is that it tends to identify the *bond form* with the idea of safety. Hence investors are led to believe that the very name “bond” must carry some especial assurance against loss. This attitude is basically unsound, and on frequent occasions is responsible for serious mistakes and loss. The investor has been spared even greater penalties for this error by the rather accidental fact that fraudulent security promoters have rarely taken advantage of the investment prestige attaching to the bond form. It is true beyond dispute that bonds as a whole enjoy a degree of safety distinctly superior to that of the average stock. But this advantage is not the result of any essential virtue of the bond form; it follows from the circumstance that the typical American enterprise is financed with some honesty and intelligence and does not assume fixed obligations without a reasonable expectation of being able to meet them. But it is not the oblication that creates the safety, nor is it the legal remedies of the bondholder in the event of default. *Safety depends upon and is measured entirely by the ability of the debtor corporation to meet its obligations.*

The bond of a business without assets or earning power would be every whit as valueless as the stock of such an enterprise. Bonds representing all the capital placed in a new venture are no safer than common stock would be, and are considerably less attractive. For the bondholders could not possibly get more out of the company by virtue of his fixed claim than he could realize if he owned the business in full, free and clear. This simple principle seems too obvious to merit statement; yet because of the traditional association of the bond form with superior safety, the investor has often been persuaded that by the mere act of limiting his return he obtained an assurance against loss.

**3. Failure of Titles to Describe Issues with Accuracy.** The basic classification of securities into bonds and stocks—or even into three main classes of bonds, preferred stocks, and commons stocks—is open to the third objection that in many cases these titles fail to supply an accurate description of the issue. This is the consequence of the steadily mounting percentage of securities which do not conform to the standard patterns, but instead modify or mingle the customary provisions.

Briefly stated, these standard patterns are as follows:

<ol type="I">
  <li>The bond pattern comprises:</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The unqualified right to a fixed interest payment on fixed dates.</li>
    <li>The unqualified right to repayment of a fixed principal amount on a fixed date.</li>
    <li>No further interest in assets or profits, and no voice in the management.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>The preferred-stock pattern comprises:</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>A stated rate of dividend in priority to any payment on the common. (Hence full preferred dividends are mandatory if the common receives any dividend; but if nothing is paid on the common, the preferred dividend is subject to the discretion of the directors).</li>
    <li>The right to a stated principal amount in the event of dissolution, in priority to any payments to the common stock.</li>
    <li>Either no voting rights, or voting power shared with the common.</li>
  </ol>

  <li>The common-stock pattern comprises:</li>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>A pro rata ownership of the company’s assets in excess of its debts and preferred stock issues.</li>
    <li>A pro rata interest in all profits in excess of prior deductions.</li>
    <li>A pro rata vote for the election of directors and for other purposes.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
