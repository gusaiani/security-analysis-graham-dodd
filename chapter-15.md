### Technique of Selecting Preferred Stocks for Investment

Our discussion of the theory of preferred stocks led to the practical conclusion that an investment preferred issue must meet all the requirements of a good bond, with an extra margin of safety to offset its contractual disadvantages. In analyzing a senior stock issue, therefore, the same tests should be applied as we have previously suggested and described with respect to bonds.

**More Stringent Requirements Suggested.** In order to make the quantitative tests more stringent, some increase is needed in the minimum earnings coverage above that prescribed for the various bond groups. The criteria we propose are as follows:

##### Minimum Average-earnings Coverage

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Class of enterprise</th>
    <th>For investment bonds</th>
    <th>For investment preferred stocks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Public utilities</td>
    <td>1¾ times fixed charges</td>
    <td>2 times fixed charges plus preferred dividends</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Railroad</td>
    <td>2 times fixed charges</td>
    <td>2½ times fixed charges plus preferred dividends</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Industrials</td>
    <td>3 times fixed charges</td>
    <td>4 times fixed charges plus preferred dividends</td>
  </tr>
</table>

These increases in the earnings coverage suggest that a corresponding advance should be made in the stock-value ratio. It may be argued that since this is a secondary test it is hardly necessary to change the figure. But consistency of treatment would require that the minimum stock-value coverage be raised in some such manner as shown in the table on page 191.

The margins of safety above suggested are materially highr than those hitherto accepted as adequate, and it may be objected that we are imposing requirements of unreasonable and prohibitive stringency. It is true that these requirements would have disqualified a large part of the preferred-stock financing done in the years prior to 1931, but such severity would have been of benefit to the investing public. A general stabilization of business and financial conditions may later justify a more lenient attitude towards the minimum earnings coverage, but until such stabilization has actually been discernible over a considerable period of time the attitude of investors towards preferred stocks must remain extremely critical and exacting.
